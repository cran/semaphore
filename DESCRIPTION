Description: Implements named semaphores from the 'boost' 'C++' library 
    <https://www.boost.org/>. A semaphore object is shared amongst several 
    processes. This integer value can be safely incremented or decremented by
    each processes. Processes can also wait (blocking) for the value to become 
    non-zero.
